## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(e1071)
#install.packages("scatterplot3d")
library(scatterplot3d)

# Generate some synthetic data
set.seed(123)
x <- seq(0, 5, by = 0.1)

y <- sin(x1) + rnorm(length(x1)) 

plot(x, y)



# Put data into a data frame
data <- data.frame(x1 = x1, x2=x2,y = y)

# Train SVR model
model_svm <- svm(y ~ x, data = data, type = "eps-regression", kernel = "radial")

support_vectors <- model_svm$SV
coefficients <- model_svm$coefs
intercept <- model_svm$rho

support_vectors
coefficients
intercept


model_lm <- lm(y ~ x+I(x^2)+I(x^3)+I(x^4), data = data)

model_svm

# Predict with the trained model
predictions <- predict(model_svm, data)
predict_lm <- predict(model_lm,data)

# Plot the results
plot(x, y, main="Support Vector vs. Least Squares Regression", col="blue", pch=16)
lines(x, predictions, col="red", lwd=2)
lines(x,predict_lm,col="green",lwd=4)
legend("topright", legend=c("Actual Data", "SVR Prediction","Least Squares"), col=c("blue", "red","green"), lwd=2, pch=16, bty="n")

```
